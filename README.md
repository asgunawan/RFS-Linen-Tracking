# Hospital Towel Tracking Dashboard (POC)

A portable, single-file **Pure HTML** dashboard for tracking hospital towels using RFID/EPCIS standard events. The entire dashboard — HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and synthetic data — is embedded in one self-contained file for easy sharing.

---

## 📋 Project Goals

| Goal | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Portability** | One `.html` file; open in any modern browser, no server needed |
| **EPCIS Standard** | Events follow the global RFID/GS1 EPCIS payload structure |
| **Multi-Ward** | Simulates a 20-bed hospital across 4 wards (5 beds per ward) |
| **10:1 Par Level** | ~193 towels for 20 beds ensures enough stock in rotation, laundry, and buffer |
| **Advanced Analytics** | Five reports covering usage, stock, lifecycle, cycle times, and forecasting |
| **Lifecycle Continuity** | Items decommission at end-of-life and are replenished with new stock to keep snapshot metrics realistic |

---

## 🏥 Hospital Configuration

- **Total beds**: 20 (5 per ward)
- **Wards**: `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`
- **Towels tracked**: ~193 individual items with heterogeneous age distribution
- **Par Level Target**: 10:1 (10 towels per bed in total circulation)
- **Simulation period**: 2025-01-01 → 2025-05-01 (**120 days**)
- **Total EPCIS events generated**: ~50,000+
- **Lifecycle policy**: retire at 100 wash cycles (`DECOMMISSION` event) + replacement towel arrival after 1–7 days

Frontend test hardcode (band-aid, non-production):
- This POC currently includes **intentional hardcoded test injections** in the generator for UI validation.
- Injects about **10 open New Linen items near simulation end** so the New Linen stock bucket is visible.
- Injects about **3 overdue items (105–110 cycles) that are not decommissioned** so the red-flag backlog bar can be tested.
- These are for frontend testing only and should be removed/disabled for realistic production simulation.

## 🔄 Towel Status Model

Items transition through four real-world states:

| Status | Trigger Condition |
|---|---|
| **New** | In `New Linen Department`; 0 wash cycles completed |
| **Washing** | Currently checked IN to `Laundry Department` |
| **Clean** | Currently checked IN to `Cleaned Linen Department` |
| **Dirty** | Checked IN to **any ward** — instantly marked dirty on arrival |

---

## 🔄 Towel Life Cycle Flow

```
New Linen Department
       ↓
 Laundry Department  ←────────────────────────────┐
       ↓                                            │
Cleaned Linen Dept                            Ward 1–4
       ↓                                            │
  Ward 1–4    ──────────────────────────────────────┘
                (towel → Dirty on IN; loops back to Laundry)
```

Towels rotate faster than bed linen (shorter ward dwell, faster laundry turnaround).

Laundry realism note:
- Laundry is modeled with a **finite machine pool** (capacity-limited), so items can queue before wash starts.
- This can represent real bottlenecks where shared laundry resources are occupied by other demand.
- If you need heavier bottlenecks, reduce the configured laundry machine count in the generator.

Operational note:
- **New Linen Department** is for brand-new stock staging.
- After a towel has entered ward usage, the operating loop is **Ward → Laundry → Clean Storage → Ward**.

Compliance anomalies simulated:
- 3% of items skip Laundry (Ward → Clean Storage directly)
- 2% of items skip first wash (New Department → Ward direct)

## 📊 Dashboard KPIs (Scorecards)

| Scorecard | Name | Logic |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | **Total Towel Inventory** | Count of all tracked EPCs |
| **2** | **Avg. Life Cycles** | Mean wash count across all active items |
| **3** | **Estimated Monthly Need** | Projected replenishment based on retirement and loss rate |
| **4** | **Towel Ward Coverage** | Towels currently in wards vs. 20-bed target |
| **5** | **Par Level Ratio** | Current active towels ÷ bed count (target: 10.0) |

---

## 📊 Reports

### 1. Towel Usage by Ward
Bar chart of daily towel `IN` events at any ward — last 30 days; filterable per ward via dropdown.

### 2. Current Stock Levels
Doughnut chart showing how many items are currently at each stage at the snapshot time.
`New Linen` | `In Laundry` | `Clean Storage` | `In Wards`

Counting rule: an item is counted in a stage only when its latest event is an open `IN` for that stage (no corresponding `OUT` yet).

### 3. Towel Life Cycle Analysis
Bar chart bucketing active (not yet decommissioned) items by wash-cycle age:
- **New (0–20 cycles)**
- **Active (21–70 cycles)**
- **Old (71–99 cycles)**
- **Overdue (100+ cycles)**

Important interpretation:
- The red bar is a **red-flag backlog indicator**: items that have reached `>=100` cycles but are still not decommissioned.
- It is **not** the count of towels already retired.

Initial cycles are read from the `INIT` meta-event embedded at the start of each item's history, enabling accurate age tracking across the full simulation window.

### 4a. Linen Cycle Time Duration
Interactive histogram showing how long items are currently parked at a selected stage (snapshot dwell time).
Toggle buttons: **New Linen | Laundry | Storage | Ward | Debug Total**

Stage-specific dwell units:
- **Laundry**: hours bucketed as `2h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 10h, 12h, 18h, 24h`
- **Ward**: hours bucketed as `2h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 10h, 12h, 18h, 24h`
- **Clean Storage**: days bucketed as `Day 1` to `Day 7`
- **New Linen**: days bucketed as `Day 1` to `Day 7`

Consistency rule: the sum of 4a bars for a selected stage must equal that stage's count in Report 2.

`Debug Total` mode shows a breakdown bar chart matching the Stock Levels doughnut exactly — use this to cross-verify both charts.

### 4b. Towel Status Snapshot
Doughnut chart of current New (Unwashed) / Washing / Clean (Ready) / Dirty counts.
This chart mirrors Report 2 using the same open-`IN` snapshot logic.

### 5. Usage Forecast (60-Day Projection)
Line chart overlaying:
- **Historical** daily ward-IN events (last 60 days, 7-day rolling average)
- **Forecasted** trend for 60 days ahead (drift model based on recent average)

Forecast KPI cards:
- Average daily ward IN events
- Items near retirement (≥70 cycles)
- Estimated days until next retirement wave
- Estimated monthly replenishment need
